## Development

### Server `(cd server)`

#### 1. Databases

&emsp;Make sure to have the databases PostgreSQL and Redis installed and running.

#### 2. Discord bot

&emsp;Create a discord server and bot.

#### 3. Environment variables

&emsp;See [constants.ts](./server/src/constants.ts) for variables that you need to define in a `.env` file in the `server` directory.

#### 4. Run `yarn watch`

#### 5. Run `yarn dev` or `yarn dev-linux`
